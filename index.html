      <p><strong>What I'm currently up to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building <a href="https://nextvoters.com" target="_blank">Next Voters</a>, the world's first website that lets you compare policies of politicians based on any user-specified query.</li>
        <li>Serving on the leadership team under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMavKrA-4do" target="_blank">Professor Manolis Kellis</a> at the <a href="https://compbio.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT Kellis Lab</a> for Mantis, an advanced AI-powered cognitive cartography tool.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Interested in:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Early childhood development and education (and consequently how AI will disrupt learning); I think there's massive opportunity to make a difference in this space.</li>
        <li>The future of AI hardware interfaces; I've been working on learning the fundamentals of hardware design by building projects like <a href="https://charmbears.com">Charm Bears</a> and am curious about what the next smart phone will look like.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Past:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built <a href="https://charmbears.com">AI-powered conversational talking teddy bears</a> for early childhood education, supported by NVIDIA Inception.</li>
        <li>Built an AI tutor sponsored by Microsoft with millions of views on TikTok and thousands of sign ups.</li>
        <li>Recruited by Stanford CS professors as the youngest Computer Science Instructor for Code in Place, an intro to CS course by the Stanford School of Engineering.</li>
        <li>Consulted for and built AI tools for productivity at Simple Ventures (venture studio backed by Shopify co-founder).</li>
        <li>Worked on named entity recognition at BenchSci (world-leader in AI for pre-clinical R&D).</li>
        <li>Figured out random ways to make money in middle school (websites/marketing for busy CEOs) and eventually made thousands of dollars from it.</li>
        <li>Made my first $100 online at 13 from a viral article I wrote investigating Apple's VR/AR patents (<a href="https://medium.com/better-marketing/apple-glass-will-do-what-google-glass-couldnt-here-s-how-580da30d57cb">link if curious</a>).</li>
      </ul>
